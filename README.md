## 🗳️ India Election Analysis (SQL Project)

## 📌 Project Overview

The India Election Analysis project focuses on analyzing Indian election results using structured SQL queries.
The project explores state-wise, constituency-wise, and party-wise election performance to uncover meaningful political and voting insights.

This project follows a traditional data analysis approach using relational datasets, strengthened by modern SQL-based querying techniques.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze state-wise election results

- Study constituency-level voting patterns

- Compare party-wise performance

- Identify winning margins and trends

- Practice real-world SQL querying and data analysis

## 🧰 Tech Stack

- SQL (MySQL / PostgreSQL compatible)

- CSV Datasets

- DBMS / SQL Client (MySQL Workbench, pgAdmin, etc.)

## 📊 Analysis Performed

- Party-wise seat distribution

- State-wise election results

- Constituency-wise winner analysis

- Vote share and result comparison

- Query-based reporting using joins, grouping, and aggregation

## 🗂️ Dataset Information

- The project uses multiple structured datasets:

- Source: Public election datasets (educational use)

- Format: CSV

- Usage: Learning and analytical purposes only
